# Technical Design Writeup

The website chosen for this assignment was Netflix. This was because Netflix has a various components to work with, such as carousels, accordions, call to actions, movie preview thumbnails. I chose the netflix browse page because this is a main feature page where users will spend most of their time if they haven't chosen anything to watch yet (which I do all the time). It also offered a variety of components to work with, such as the movie cards, carousels, the nav bar and featured movie card. I chose the login page because of this reason as well. It had the sign in container component, some showcase cards, accordions and a footer. I wanted to be able to design and code different kinds of components to apply things we've learned such as hooks, props and routers while fulfilling the assignment requirements.

## Chosen Components

### Carousel
The carousel allowed me to use useState to create two different states for the moviecard previews. One that scales up and shows buttons and one that's just a thumbnail. I chose this component because I thought it was a good use of useState and it helped me understand it better.

### Navbar
The navbar was also a very important component in for this project. 
    1. Pretty much every website has one.
    2. It was also a good component to use the React Router and useHistory hook

### Moviecard
The movie card was chosen because of the props that it can take such as thumbnails, genres, and names and because it was a good component to use the useState hook with.

### Showcase and accordions
The showcase and accorion components were chosen because I wanted to apply ternaries, by giving these components two different states and I wanted to simulate getting data from a database by creating label objects.
